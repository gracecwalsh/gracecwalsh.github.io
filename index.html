					<p style= "color: #32612D; font-size: 120%;">Hi, my name is Grace Walsh and I am a student at the University of Wisconsin.Growing up, I always loved being in the kitchen and learning skills from my mom, but I found it challenging to find healthy recipes and cook them for myself at college. Through trial and error, I have amassed a handful of key recipes that have made cooking for myself much easier and more exciting. I'm by no means an expert in the kitchen, so these recipes only require simple kitchen tools that would be found in any standard dorm or apartment kitchen, as well as ingredients that are easy to find in any local grocery stores.  </p>
